# Basics of Unit Testing

## The Three Laws of Test Driven Development (TDD):
TDD is a set of programming and software design principles, based on a cycle of:
fail test -> fix code -> pass test -> fail new test...
Writes reliable, flexible and modular pieces of software.

1. You may not write production code unless you have first written a "failing unit test".
2. You may not write more of a unit test than is "sufficient to fail".
3. You may not write more production code than is "sufficient to" make the "failing unit test pass"
